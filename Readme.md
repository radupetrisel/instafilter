# Instafilter

This is project 13 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/instafilter-introduction)). This project is an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects.

As usual, there will be three challenges at the end of the guided tutorial for me to implement on my own.

## Challenges

** Challenge #1**: Try making the Save button disabled if there is no image in the image view.

** Challenge #2**: Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
